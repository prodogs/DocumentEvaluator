# Centralized State Management Implementation

## Summary

We've implemented a centralized state management system for the BatchProcessingService to ensure batch processing integrity. The UI can now only request state changes, and the BatchService validates and controls all state transitions.

## Key Changes

### 1. BatchService State Machine (batch_service.py)

Added centralized state management with:
- **State Machine Definition**: Clear states and valid transitions
- **Single Entry Point**: `request_state_change()` method for all state changes
- **Action Handlers**: Specific methods for each state transition
- **Validation**: All transitions are validated before execution

```python
def request_state_change(self, batch_id: int, action: str, context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Central method for all batch state change requests."""
    # Validates current state
    # Checks if transition is allowed  
    # Performs transition if valid
    # Returns success/failure with reason
```

### 2. API Routes Updated (batch_routes.py)

All batch modification endpoints now use centralized state management:
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/reprocess-staging` → uses `request_state_change(batch_id, 'restage')`
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/rerun` → uses `request_state_change(batch_id, 'rerun')`
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/pause` → uses `request_state_change(batch_id, 'pause')`
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/resume` → uses `request_state_change(batch_id, 'resume')`
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/reset-to-prestage` → uses `request_state_change(batch_id, 'reset')`

Added new unified endpoint:
- `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/action` - Universal endpoint for all batch actions

### 3. Queue Processor Integration (batch_queue_processor.py)

Updated to report back to BatchService instead of updating database directly:
- Task completion: calls `batch_service.handle_task_completion(task_id, result_data)`
- Task failure: calls `batch_service.handle_task_failure(task_id, error_data)`
- All document status updates now go through BatchService

### 4. State Transition Rules

Implemented validation for all state transitions:
- **Reset**: Only allowed if batch is in SAVED, FAILED, or COMPLETED state
- **Pause**: Only allowed if batch is ANALYZING and has active tasks
- **Resume**: Only allowed if batch is PAUSED
- **Cancel**: Only allowed if batch is ANALYZING or PAUSED
- **Restage**: Only allowed if batch is COMPLETED, FAILED, or SAVED

### 5. Protection Against Race Conditions

- Added check to prevent resetting batches that are actively processing
- All state changes are atomic and validated
- Queue processors report status changes instead of direct DB updates

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: BatchService owns all state transitions
2. **No Race Conditions**: Centralized validation prevents conflicting operations
3. **Clear Audit Trail**: All state changes logged with context
4. **Better Error Messages**: Invalid operations return meaningful error messages
5. **Simplified UI Logic**: UI just requests actions, doesn't manage state

## Next Steps

1. Update UI to use the new `/api/batches/<int:batch_id>/action` endpoint
2. Add database row locking for concurrent access protection  
3. Implement batch version numbers for optimistic locking
4. Add comprehensive state change audit logging

## Example Usage

```javascript
// UI requesting a batch reset
fetch(`/api/batches/${batchId}/action`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        action: 'reset',
        context: { reason: 'User requested reset' }
    })
});

// Response will indicate if action was allowed
{
    "success": false,
    "error": "Cannot reset batch in ANALYZING state",
    "current_state": "ANALYZING",
    "allowed_actions": ["pause", "cancel"]
}
```

## Conclusion

The BatchProcessingService is now solely responsible for batch processing integrity. The UI can request changes, but the BatchService validates and controls all state transitions, ensuring the system maintains consistency and prevents invalid operations.
