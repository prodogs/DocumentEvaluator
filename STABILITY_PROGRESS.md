# Stability Implementation Progress Tracker

## Current Status: Starting Small (2025-06-02)

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Created stability helpers (`server/utils/stability_helpers.py`)
2. Created monitoring routes (`server/api/monitoring_routes.py`)
3. Created example implementation (`server/services/stable_batch_service_example.py`)
4. **Renamed "Local Database" ‚Üí "KnowledgeSync Database"** for clarity
   - Updated all references in monitoring, tests, and documentation
   - Created DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md to explain the two-database system
   - KnowledgeSync = Main app database (can reside anywhere)
   - KnowledgeDocuments = Processing queue database

### üîÑ Next Step: Add Monitoring
```python
# Add to server/app.py after line 133 (where other routes are registered):
from api.monitoring_routes import register_monitoring_routes
register_monitoring_routes(app)
```

### üìã Testing Checklist
- [x] Add monitoring routes to app.py
- [x] Restart server
- [x] Test endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/health/detailed`
- [x] Test endpoint: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/dashboard`
- [x] Verify all health checks work
- [x] Create monitoring dashboard HTML

### üéØ Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Monitoring (TODAY)
- [x] Create monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Add to app.py
- [ ] Test all endpoints
- [ ] Create simple dashboard HTML (optional)

#### Phase 2: Retry Logic (NEXT SESSION)
- [ ] Add retry to BatchService.run_batch()
- [ ] Add retry to staging_service._perform_staging()
- [ ] Add retry to all database operations
- [ ] Test with simulated failures

#### Phase 3: Circuit Breakers (AFTER RETRY)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker to RAG API calls
- [ ] Add circuit breaker to KnowledgeDocuments connections
- [ ] Test circuit breaker behavior
- [ ] Add circuit breaker status to monitoring

#### Phase 4: Validation & Safety (WEEK 2)
- [ ] Add input validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] Add transaction safety to batch operations
- [ ] Add data consistency checks
- [ ] Create automated tests

### üí¨ Context for Next Session

**REMIND ME TO:**
1. Check if monitoring was successfully added
2. Review any issues you encountered
3. Start Phase 2 (Retry Logic) implementation
4. Focus on the most problematic areas you identified

**CURRENT PROBLEMS TO SOLVE:**
- Cascading failures when one service is down
- No visibility into system health
- No automatic recovery from transient failures
- Duplicate data creation on retries

**YOUR LAST CONCERN:**
"how does this happen you fix one thing and break another"

**OUR SOLUTION APPROACH:**
Using OOP, dependency injection, and proper error handling to prevent cascading failures

### üìä Metrics to Track
Before implementing each phase, note these metrics:
- Average batch failure rate: ____%
- Recovery time after failure: ____ minutes
- Cascading failure frequency: ____ per week
- Time to detect issues: ____ minutes

### üîó Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Test monitoring endpoints
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health/detailed | jq .
curl http://localhost:5001/api/dashboard | jq .
curl http://localhost:5001/api/metrics/batches | jq .

# Check server logs for new monitoring info
tail -f server/app.log | grep -E "(health|monitor|metric)"

# Quick stability test
python test_key_changes.py
```

**TO RESUME:** Just say "Let's continue with stability improvements" and I'll:
1. Check this progress file
2. Review what phase we're in
3. Continue from where we left off
