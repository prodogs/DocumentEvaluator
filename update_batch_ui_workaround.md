# Batch Processing Workaround

## Issue
The "Rerun Analysis" and "Restage & Rerun" buttons are not working because the backend LLM processing has been moved to the KnowledgeDocuments database, but the UI hasn't been updated to reflect this architectural change.

## Current Status
- Batch 70 is in SAVED status (ready to be staged)
- The batch has 8 documents
- LLM responses are stored in a separate KnowledgeDocuments database

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Use the Process Script
Run the provided script to manually process the batch:
```bash
cd /Users/frankfilippis/AI/Github/DocumentEvaluator
python3 process_batch_70.py
```

### Option 2: Update the UI to Hide Non-Working Buttons
Since the backend architecture has changed, we can update the UI to hide the non-functional buttons and show only what works.

### Option 3: External Processing
Since LLM processing is now in the KnowledgeDocuments database, you may need to:
1. Use an external process to handle the actual LLM API calls
2. The DocumentEvaluator now serves as a configuration and monitoring interface
3. The actual processing happens in the KnowledgeDocuments system

## What's Working
- ✅ Viewing batches
- ✅ Viewing batch details
- ✅ Viewing LLM responses (from KnowledgeDocuments)
- ✅ Reset to Prestage
- ✅ Delete batch

## What's Not Working
- ❌ Rerun Analysis (deprecated endpoint)
- ❌ Restage & Rerun (staging service deprecated)
- ❌ Stage button (staging service deprecated)
- ❌ Run Analysis (processing moved to external system)

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Check if there's an external processing system for the KnowledgeDocuments database
2. Update the UI to reflect the new architecture
3. Remove or disable non-functional buttons
4. Add documentation about the new processing workflow
