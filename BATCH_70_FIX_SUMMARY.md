# Batch 70 Loading Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
Batch 70 was failing to load details in the frontend. The issue was traced to the backend returning hardcoded values for LLM response statistics.

## Root Cause
The `get_batch_info()` method in `batch_service.py` was returning:
- `total_responses: 0` (hardcoded)
- `status_counts: {}` (empty object)
- `completion_percentage: 0` (hardcoded)

This caused the frontend's `getProgressPercentage()` function to always return 0, which may have led to display issues.

## Solution
Updated two methods in `/server/services/batch_service.py`:

### 1. `get_batch_info()` method (lines 1862-1942)
- Added code to query the KnowledgeDocuments database for actual LLM response statistics
- Queries `llm_responses` table to get:
  - Total count of responses for the batch
  - Status counts grouped by status (P, S, F, etc.)
  - Calculated completion percentage based on completed statuses (S, F)
- Includes error handling to fall back to default values if KnowledgeDocuments is unavailable

### 2. `list_batches()` method (lines 1944-2024)
- Added bulk query to fetch statistics for all batches in one database call
- Efficiently retrieves total responses and completion percentages for multiple batches
- Improves performance by avoiding N+1 query problem

## Changes Made
1. Modified `get_batch_info()` to fetch real statistics from KnowledgeDocuments database
2. Modified `list_batches()` to include real completion percentages
3. Both methods now properly handle database connection errors with fallback values

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Start the server: `cd server && python app.py`
2. Access batch 70 through the UI or API: `GET http://localhost:5001/api/batches/70`
3. The response should now include actual values for:
   - `total_responses`: Actual count from database
   - `status_counts`: Object with status codes as keys and counts as values
   - `completion_percentage`: Calculated percentage of completed responses

## Next Steps
1. Restart the server to apply the changes
2. Test batch 70 in the frontend to confirm it loads properly
3. Monitor logs for any database connection issues with KnowledgeDocuments
