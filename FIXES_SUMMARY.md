# Fixes Summary

## 1. LLM Response Explorer UI Improvements

### Changes Made:
1. **Added "Prompts" Label**: The Response tab now clearly labels the prompts section with "üìù Prompts" header
2. **Full Response Display**: Removed height restrictions to ensure the entire response is displayed
3. **Improved Layout**: Better visual hierarchy with proper sections

### UI Updates:
- `client/src/components/LlmResponsesViewer.jsx`:
  - Added `prompt-tabs-section` wrapper with `prompts-section-label` header
  - Shows prompt tabs for all responses (not just multiple prompts)

- `client/src/styles/llm-responses-viewer.css`:
  - Added styling for `.prompt-tabs-section` and `.prompts-section-label`
  - Removed `max-height: 400px` from `.response-raw-text` to show full responses
  - Added `max-height: calc(100vh - 300px)` to `.prompt-response-section` for better scrolling
  - Ensured proper text wrapping with `white-space: pre-wrap` and `word-wrap: break-word`

## 2. Invalid Document Types Fix

### Problem:
Invalid document types were being queued because the batch service was using hardcoded file extensions instead of respecting the preprocessing validation.

### Solution:
Modified the batch service to only use documents that have been validated during preprocessing:

1. **Batch Creation** (`server/services/batch_service.py`):
   - Now only includes documents with `valid = 'Y'` from preprocessing
   - Removed hardcoded file extension checks
   - Uses existing preprocessed documents instead of rescanning folders

2. **Config Snapshot**:
   - Gets validated documents from the database instead of filesystem scanning
   - Ensures consistency with preprocessing validation

### Key Changes:
- Line 822-826: Added `Document.valid == 'Y'` filter when getting documents
- Line 691-707: Changed to use validated documents from DB instead of filesystem scan
- Line 785-806: Modified to count only valid preprocessed documents

### Benefits:
- Only document types validated during preprocessing will be queued
- Consistent behavior across the system
- Respects the comprehensive validation rules from `folder_preprocessing_service.py`
- Prevents invalid file types from entering the processing queue

## Testing

1. **UI Testing**:
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Navigate to "üîç Responses" tab
   - Click any response to open detail modal
   - Click "üí¨ Response" tab
   - Verify "Prompts" label appears
   - Verify full response text is displayed without truncation

2. **Document Type Validation Testing**:
   - Preprocess a folder with mixed file types
   - Create a batch with that folder
   - Verify only valid document types (as defined in preprocessing) are included
   - Run the batch and verify no invalid types are queued

## Notes

- The preprocessing service validates against a comprehensive set of extensions
- The batch service now respects these validations instead of using its own subset
- This ensures consistency across the entire document processing pipeline
