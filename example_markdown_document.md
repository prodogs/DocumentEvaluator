# Example Markdown Document

This is an example markdown document that demonstrates the newly added support for `.md` files in the DocumentEvaluator system.

## Overview

The DocumentEvaluator system now fully supports markdown files with the following capabilities:

- **File Recognition**: `.md` files are recognized as valid document types
- **MIME Type Handling**: Properly mapped to `text/markdown` MIME type
- **Folder Scanning**: Included in directory traversal and file discovery
- **Validation**: Passes all file validation checks
- **Processing**: Can be processed by LLM services for analysis

## Technical Details

### Supported Features

1. **Headers** (H1-H6)
2. **Text Formatting**
   - *Italic text*
   - **Bold text**
   - `Inline code`
3. **Lists**
   - Unordered lists
   - Ordered lists
4. **Code Blocks**
5. **Tables**
6. **Links and Images**

### Code Example

```python
def process_markdown(file_path):
    """Process a markdown file through the document evaluation system"""
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # The system will now recognize and process this file
    return content
```

### Data Table

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| File Recognition | ✅ Supported | Added to all extension lists |
| MIME Type | ✅ Supported | `text/markdown` |
| Validation | ✅ Supported | Passes all checks |
| Processing | ✅ Supported | Ready for LLM analysis |

## Benefits

Adding markdown support provides several benefits:

1. **Documentation Processing**: Technical documentation in markdown format can now be analyzed
2. **README Files**: Project README files can be evaluated
3. **Knowledge Base**: Markdown-based knowledge bases can be processed
4. **Broader Coverage**: Supports more file types commonly used in technical environments

## Implementation

The support was added by updating the following components:

- `FolderPreprocessingService.VALID_EXTENSIONS`
- `DocumentEncodingService.supported_extensions`
- `RAGServiceClient._get_mime_type()`
- `traverse_directory()` function
- Various utility and test files

## Conclusion

Markdown files (`.md`) are now fully supported across the entire DocumentEvaluator system and can be processed alongside other document types like PDF, DOCX, TXT, and others.
